              In May 2019, I broke Google's "Golden Handcuffs" because it became clear to me that if
              far more isn’t <br />
              done to train a new generation of leaders committed to civic innovation, humanity will
              sink under the <br />

              I spent three years doing anything and everything to get CU off the

              Landing a job at Google was a dream come true. I more or less worked all of college to

              We helped carry out the top-to-bottom redesign and implementation of Cloud <br />

              April 2019, we launched our initial SQL Server offering - which is poised to increase

              Obsessed with finding music that brings people joy, my friend Nik and I scoured the

              collecting tracks from bedroom electronic music producers who we considered to be
              pioneers of a rare <br />
              form of "musical medicine."
            </p>
            <p class="last_p">
              This "medicine" metaphor was very real to us, especially for me. Feel-good electronic

              Nik and I <br />
              quickly saw that we weren't the only beneficiaries of the emerging genre. As we shared
              the songs with <br />
              our friends, we saw the music provided a similarly therapeutic effect for them.
            </p>
            <p class="last_p">
              Seeing the potential of this genre to make people's lives better, we set off on a
              mission to help <br />
              as many people in the world as possible get a taste of what we had enjoyed for years.
              Out of <br />
              this mission came Dancing Pineapple, which was the music blog and events company that
              Nik and I used to <br />
              fill the huge "feel-good electronic music"-shaped hole in the world.
